class RapidProABTestCreator(object):
    '''Modifies RapidPro flows to support A/B testing.

    This class takes a RapidPro json file as input.
    The method `apply_abtests` accepts a list of A/B test specifications,
    and produces RapidPro flows that assign users to A/B test groups,
    and interact with the users differently (as specified in the A/B test
    specifications) depending on which test groups they have been assigned to.
    The method `export_to_json` exports the result to a specified json file.

    Notes:
    - We assume the input is valid, conforming to e.g.
      https://github.com/fagiothree/excel-to-json-flow/blob/main/types/index.ts
    - We keep the flow uuids (and most other uuids) the same, i.e. the uuids
      in the output are the same as in the input and will overwrite the input
      when importing in RapidPro
    - Each A/B test operation is replace_bit_of_text, and refers to text within
      a send_msg action. If multiple nodes match the text, the operation will
      affect all of these nodes.
      - The row_id from the A/B testing spreadsheets is ignored
      - Further operations may be supported in future versions.
    - No ui_ output yet, RapidPro will lay it out in a single column.
      TODO: Take input node layout, modify sensibly.
